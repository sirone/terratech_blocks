GSODeliCannon_222:Delivery Cannons sell unwanted items back to Earth earning money. This one is static, it will only work whilst anchored.\n\nLow orbital interplanetary relay (LOIR) is a method was pioneered by Dr. Bernard Steen. Steen developed the process to smuggle controlled substances from one planet to another with efficiency and anonymity. On the ground a 'Delivery Cannon' is loaded with the object one wishes to send. It then blasts the payload into low orbit where a radio-controlled relay satellite collects it and sends it on the desired trajectory through space to its destination. Steen was eventually caught by the authority. He avoided prison by striking a deal to "share" the process with off-world mining corporations and interplanetary postal services. He even receives a 1% cut from the profit of each item that is sent. He currently splits his time between Titan and Mars as a tax-exile. [pl]

The original inspiration for the Fabricator came from a vintage sci-fi TV show, aired in the late 20th century, in this show a device called a 'Replicator' could make any food instantly from pure energy. Dr.'s Hartley and Phuquestayne saw the potential applications for a real replication device and began work on this project together. Their labour soon bore fruit in the form of a prototype device that they dubbed, the Fabricator. Operators could combine different materials in this machine and it would produce something completely new. [pl]

GSOHoverJet_111:Small hover plates to reduce friction and keep your Techs floating.\n\nDr. Daryl Titcomb, a marine electronics engineer, confirmed hydrophobe and self-styled anti-gravity bender, developed the first early prototypes of the technology we now use in hover plates. His initial intention was to develop a mode of transportation over water that would not involve touching it (because it's gross). After a serious injury incurred by trying to use monkfish as a superconductor, Titcomb's arch nemesis - Sir John John Johnson the Third attempted to steal his plans for the hover technology. The dispute over who would lay claim to authorship of the technology was eventually decided by duel. Lucky for Titcomb, his skills learned as an avid historical battle reenactor granted him the upper hand, Sir Johnson was swiftly dispatched and Titcomb reclaimed his legacy. [pl]

He entranced the crowd at once, flipping back and forth, bamboozling them with his nimble verse. The crowd was transfixed and enthralled until one prospector noticed Silver's accomplice - Noah Webster was busy stealing, scrapping and selling all of their Techs from the parking area. Silver had been distracting the crowd to cover the caper. So goes the story of the final performance of Jock Silver, as neither he nor Webster was ever heard from again. [pl]

VENBooster_111:A powerful pulse booster jet in a small package.\n\nThe Little Stud Pulse Booster system was created by a Metal Machinist known as Big Will McDonald. McDonald's breakthrough came whilst working on the "Space Fill" project, the idea was to avoid polluting the Earth by forgoing landfills in favour of blasting waste materials into outer space. The original problem was the expense of the process, it simply didn't make economic sense to pay for the fuel required. However, thanks to the combined breakthroughs of Oleite self-replenishing fuel tanks and McDonald's super efficient pulse booster technology, which many have described as "beyond effective", we no longer have to worry about the vast amounts of mess and wastage we produce as a species. We're now safe in the knowledge that we can just shoot it away into space for someone else to worry about! [pl]
VENBoosterDouble_211:Radical! What's better than one booster? Two Boosters! Two Double Boosters, no wait, that would be four boosters, this is one double booster, two jets in total. Let's not get carried away. [pl]
VENBracketRightAngle_111:A right angle bracket piece. A sturdy and lightweight solution for when you want to stick that thing on the side. [pl]
VENBracketStraight_111:A simple lighweight bracket with an Attach Point at each end. This is just the thing for keeping the strength up and the weight down. [pl]
VENBracketStraight_211:A longer variant of the straight bracket.\n\nThough rather humble at first glance, the introduction of brackets has revolutionised many Tech designers' output. Brackets were first introduced by Professor Ruin, of the Idont Institute in the Western Americadia Republic. Their genius is their simplicity, Ruin saw that if he stripped away all of the unnecessary bulk and weight, a much stronger superstructure could be created that just provided people with raw attach points linked by strong high density metals. Ruin originally devised them for the construction of land train style Techs. Since then, their use has stretched far and wide being favoured particularly by quadcopter fanatics and Venture dirt bike racers. Ruin is recently recovering from an allergic reaction to medication he was taking for his heart condition, he is said to be out of the woods and making a strong recovery. [pl]

VENFabricator_322:This Venture Fabricator will allow you to craft Venture blocks from resource chunks. [pl]
VENFlameThrower_121:This Flamethrower is great for showing off to your friends whilst doing wheelies. It's not much good for, you know, fighting or mining or anything.\n\nMany say that Dr. Lawrence Hartley was a deeply changed man following the demise of this collegue-come-rival Dr. Dick Phuquestayne following their completion of the Fabricator project. Hartley stepped down as chair of the Good Day Project and returned with his family to his native Canada. During this stage in his career, he turned away from inventions for the good of mankind and instead, to the surprise of many began work on weapons technologies. His efforts included the so called the 'Fusion Toothbrush', which would explode 30 seconds after it was turned on and the Reaper X1 Flamethrower, a devastating pyrotechnic weapon that he sold to the Venture corporation. Recent rumours suggest that he has turned a corner and may be in talks to take up his position at the Good Day Project once again. [pl]

VENGyro_AllAxis_Active_111:This Gyro is excellent for stabilising aircraft that are tricky to fly or for building unstable Techs with two legs or one wheel or whatever. If you have enough of these things, they will hold anything up. This gyro is "active", meaning it will apply torque to force your Tech back to an upright position. And it's also "all axis", meaning it works in all three rotational directions.\n\n***Breaking News*** Molecular biologist, Dr. Chrii Von Vieh of the Germland Institute in Scotmany, noted inventor of the Plasma Cutter & Gyro Rotor, has been sectioned under the mental health act. Dr. Chrii is said to be suffering from delusions and mania. Aides close to the renowned doctor reported receiving severe dressing downs if they failed to address the doctor by "his proper title" - "Lemon Lord, Amber Eminence". The doctor claimed to be a "Royal Advisor" to "The Lemon King". The situation escalated on Tuesday afternoon when during a dispute over lab equipment in the Germland Space Institute, Dr. Chrii attacked a colleague by pinning him down and squeezing a blood orange into his eyes. The Von Vieh family have said that Dr. Chrii has been overworked for months but is now stable and just requires rest. They expect him to make a full recovery in time. [pl]

One unlucky sap that fell foul of his schemes was Theus_TM, a close friend of the assassination android known as MurderBot. MurderBot and Theus chased BitMage all the way back to his shanty shack with every intention of breaking BitMage into tiny pieces. But BitMage made it back just in time to throw up his trusty shield projector. The generator then promptly broke and the shield quit. BitMage heard the squeak of wheels lurching forward. In desperation, BitMage gave the generator a tremendous kick, and it spluttered back to life shooting the shield back up, before failing again. But, Murderbot had surged forward and got caught mid-beam, splitting him neatly in two. [pl]

VENWheel_Single_D_224:A long angled fork version of the Springer wheel. Go! [pl]
VENWheel_Sports1_Left_112:This Dune Wheel is very similar to a Globe Trotter, but with an added fender to keep the dust down and an extra attach point on top. [pl]
VENWheel_Sports1_Right_112:This Dune Wheel is very similar to a Globe Trotter, but with an added fender to keep the dust down and an extra attach point on top. [pl]
VENWheel_Titan_666:The REAL Daddy! Words can't describe the awesomness of this balloon tyre with deep tractor treads. These things are the ultimate in all terrain power and speed. They can carry a fair amount too. [pl]
VENWing_322:For your inner boy racer. This will keep you grounded at high speeds. [pl]
VENWingAngledLeft_423:Rudder Tipped Wings have both horizontal and vertical flaps, adding to stability and versatility for minimalist plane designs and enabling grander aircraft an extra free set of tail wing-style vertical rudders. [pl]
VENWingAngledRight_423:Rudder Tipped Wings have both horizontal and vertical flaps, adding to stability and versatility for minimalist plane designs and enabling grander aircraft an extra free set of tail wing-style vertical rudders. [pl]
VENWingExpanderLeft_413:A left Venture expander wing. [pl]
VENWingExpanderRight_413:A right Venture expander wing. [pl]
VENWingMiddle_312:A wing section that can be used to make a wider wingspan and give more lift to a flying Tech. [pl]
VENWingSmall_211:For a more discerning boy racer - less garish… right? [pl]
VENWingTail_122:A Venture tail wing. [pl]
VENWingTiny_111:This small spoiler is perfect for providing a bit of down force on a small scout vehicle. It also has 3 Attach Points - what a treat! [pl]
EXP_Hover_424:The largest and highest floating hover platform available. This makes for a perfect perch to rain down fire from above, just so long as you can control where it drifts. [pl]
EXPCannonRepulsor_444:The Repulsor Cannon is a ground-to-air anti-aircraft weapon that fires an electro-magnetic charge which generates a repulsion pulse when they collide with their target. These pulses cause low damage to the target, but have very high impulse force, which knock most flying Techs off-course making it very difficult to continue flying once hit. This weapon can only be placed in an upright orientation. [pl]
EXPFlamethrowerPlasma_112:The flame on this thing is blue! BLUE! Do you know how hot blue fire is? No? Neither do I… but it's definitely hotter than that rubbish orange fire. Yeah, once you use blue fire, you're not going to want to mess around with that orange stuff anymore. What's the point? [pl]
GCBuzzSaw_246:The GeoCorp Buzz Saw is mainly used for cutting trees in half. The Excavator is the next step up in the series. This tool is mainly used for cutting planets in half. Yes. That's right. A planet! Oh look! You can plug it in with a regular household plug too. You don't need one of those special power tool ones, that's handy. [pl]
GCHover_222:GeoCorp, making a Hover Plate? But they don't have any way to steer it… or propel it… But look at the size of this thing! Do you know how much it can lift? No? Neither do I, but I bet that it's a lot! Oh boy! [pl]
GCPlasmaCutter_Auto_434:This gimbal mounted Plasma cutter is a great tool for zapping those hard to reach resources. Oh wait, for some reason it locks onto target other Techs? Well that's odd… I'm sure they'll sort out that bug out with a firmware update later. Anyway, although you gain in freedom of movement, it is a little less potent in the power department, but it has a slightly longer range than other Plasma Cutters to make up for it. [pl]
GSOMegatonLong_242:Roughly twice as powerful as the Megaton Cannon, but fires at half the speed. This cannon is bigger, heavier and tougher, but boy, does it go with a bang! [pl]
HE_Battery_211:A heavy duty battery pack with a ruggedised casing that can handle more than a few knocks. Much more sturdy than any other battery for its size. This baby ain't cheap, or light, but it stores more than double the capacity of that GSO rubbish and it also comes it this awesome stealth black design. Sure, the LEDs make it a little less stealthy, but yeah. [pl]
HE_CannonBattleship_216:The heaviest ballistic weapon currently licensed for use in off-world colonies. This battleship class gun has an incredibly long range and high power. It will not rotate, so whatever weapons platform you attach it to will need to do most of the aiming. But when it is on target it will really make a mess. These super heavyweight ballistics take a long time to reload too, so make sure it's on target when pressing the fire button. [pl]
HE_LaserZeus_222:The eggheads in the lab have finally managed to produce this energy weapon that we can mount to a full rotation turret. This aint your average laser pointer, it will really ruin your day if you shine it into your eyes. [pl]
HE_Mortar_232:Listen up Meatheads! This is the one you've been waiting for. A heavy payload fixed mortar launcher. This baby isn't the fastest firing mortar, but it has a long reach and it will really ruin someone's day when the shell hits them. [pl]
HE_TurretRoundabout_111:This quad barrel launcher fires further and does more damage than the GSO one. It also rotates, it's a little slow, but it does turn. It doesn't have as many barrels, but it makes use of the ones that it has. [pl]
HE_WheelLarge_244:The Big Daddy! Faster and tougher than the GeoCorp Big Boy. It's not got as much torque and can't shift as much weight. But If you're looking for the right wheels for a battle-ready Tech, this is what you need. [pl]
HE_WheelMid_233:The armoured Warhorse. These wheels are tougher and faster than anything GeoCorp make in this size. Sure they can't carry as much, but they're built for combat, not for lugging junk around. [pl]
VENCannonRapid_313:A lightweight, fast firing heavy armament. This twin barrel cannon can outpace a Megaton in rate of fire and range, although it is let down slightly in the damage and blast radius departments. Still a solid bit of kit. [pl]
VENDropper_111:Ten blok produkcyjny może być przymocowany do dowolnego taśmociągu, aby umożliwić oderwanie trzymanego surowca i zrzucenie go na ziemię.
VENFilter_111:Connect this filter to a conveyor loop. Imprint it with an item by dragging the item on top of it. Once imprinted it will filter that item out from the rest. [pl]
VENLaserMachineGun_112:This fast firing NEEDLE laser will chip away at its target with a furious rain of laser bolts. It can't rotate all the way around, so you'll need to position it manually. It also gets pretty hot when it's been firing for a while, so no touchy! [pl]
VENLaserTurret_111:They said it couldn't be done. A laser weapon mounted to a rotating turret? "Nah, can't be done" said the boffins at GSO and Hawkeye. Well look who cracked it - Venture! Sure, it's lost a bit of power in the production process, but the trade off for a wider range of attack is worth it, right? Oh darn, it doesn't tilt up and down very much… Hmmm. [pl]
VENMachineGunForward_311:The Crossfire is a fixed mid-range rifle that packs more of a punch than the Hail Fire, but has a slower rate of fire. It also needs to be aimed directly at the target to connect as it is not gimbal mounted. [pl]
VENTracks_112:A fast and grippy off-road track, great for taking rough terrain at speed. Less good for carrying heavy weight or damage. [pl]
VENTracks_124:A beefy off-road track built for speed over rough terrain. Not the toughest under fire and it wasn't made to carry a heavy burden, but it will get you through the trickiest inclines, at speed, with ease. [pl]
VENTurretRoundabout_111:A twin barrel mortar launcher that can rotate all the way around and it can do it fast. Sure, these shells don't hit as hard as the GSO ones, or go quite as far, but they are much better at hitting their mark from a speeding buggy! [pl]
HE_ArmourPlate_111:This Small Armour Plate is tougher than the GSO one, but it's also more expensive and heavier.\n\nThis armour plating was developed by Dr. D. Noaksey, a biologist of the Independent Game and Fisheries Advocates Association. He originally wanted to build frog armour to save an endangered species from becoming roadkill. The discovery and implementation of aggregated carbon nanorods that Dr. Noaksey developed, allowed the minerals to be put into a state of a temporal flux making it a pliable material to allow its application to a surface to increase its defensive structure, making it possible to fabricate small armoured suits for the rare Green Peppered Frog to wear which were flexible enough for the frog to move around in and could withstand the pressure of having a tank rolled over them. [pl]
HE_ArmourPlate_211:This Medium Armour Plate is tougher than the GSO one, but it's also more expensive and heavier. [pl]
HE_ArmourPlate_221:This Large Armour Plate is tougher than the GSO and GeoCorp ones, but it's also more expensive. [pl]
HE_ArmourPlate_Extended_221:The Notch Armour Plate is tougher than the GSO and GeoCorp ones of a similar size, but it's also more expensive. It also includes an Attach Point on the outside to mount extra weapons to. [pl]
HE_ShotgunRotating_212:The Axis Shotgun is mounted on a fully rotating turret. It has a little less power than the Bayonet Shotgun, takes up more space and fires a tad slower, but makes up for it in versatility. [pl]
VENShotgunRotating_112:Strzelba "360" obraca się we wszystkich kierunkach. Jest słabszy niż strzelba kontaktowa i ma niższą szybkostrzelność. Ale wróg pozostanie na celowniku nie ważne dokąd zmierza!
GSOBigBertha_845:A 420mm M-Grade Gun. Technically a naval class weapon, but you can mount it on anything that's big enough to carry it.\n\nOf German origin, the gun was mainly designed by SRQ Technologies Director of Design, Senior Ra'Gequi. It can fire a 820kg high explosive shell roughly 8 miles. [pl]
VENMicroMissile_112:This battery launches six micro-missiles into a swarming cluster that will home-in on any nearby targets. Fly my pretties! Fly! [pl]
GCBooster_422:Ten gigantyczny dopalacz ma wbudowany zbiornik paliwa. Został zaprojektowany, aby pomóc Techom z większej wagi, ominąć wyboje lub wzgórza, gdy walczą z własnym ciężarem.
VENHydraulicRamSmall_111:Developed by a fluidics engineer, Dr. Wren Hensgen. He was originally trying to create a new type of hydraulic trouser press, but got carried away and ended up with a hydraulic ram capable of launching 50 metric tons of machinery over a house. [pl]
GCFlail_446:The GeoCorp TB Thresher combines a flail/grinder with a collector. It's a great tool for harvesting and collecting resources all in one combined block. The original prototype for this block was developed by Mr T. Bear, although his blueprint was for a much smaller GSO model. GeoCorp saw the potential and took the project on, beefing the unit up significantly and got it to market first. [pl]
GC_BigPete_Consumer_222:Om nom nom nom nom nom! [pl]
GSOMGunFixed_111_EC:The ZK-50X is an upgraded version of the Kempykov. Fit for the modern battlefield. [pl]
GSOCannonTurret_111_EC:A more advanced cannon turret than the 3-Pounder. Packs a knockout punch. [pl]
GCPlasmaCutter_Angled_222_EC:An industrial grade, heavy mining tool using cutting edge focused photon beam technology. [pl]
GCArticulatedDrill_423_EC:An articulated drill grinder with very dense crystal tips. This is the deluxe model reserved for serious tradespeople only. [pl]
VENFlameThrower_PS4_122:The X2 is a generous upgrade from the X1 model. This Flamethrower is perfect for summer BBQs around the pool or for scorched-earth warfare tactics. [pl]
VENMgun_PS4_112:A new twist on an old classic. I heard they only made 50 of these things and that each one came with a personalised engraved display case. Pretty braggable. [pl]
HE_Shotgun_XboxOne_112:The Rhino shotgun is a devastating short range projectile weapon. If you really want to make an entrance in style, bring the Rhino. [pl]
HE_LaserZeus_XboxOne_222:The instructions on this thing just say 'point front towards enemy' and 'use supplied goggles', but there aren’t any goggles here. I guess they forgot to pack the goggles. [pl]
HE_ArmourPlate_XboxOne_211:This Medium Armour Plate is tougher than the GSO one, but it's also more expensive and heavier. [pl]
HE_StdBlock_01_XboxOne_111:This block is heavy duty, strong and resilient. It's also a bit more expensive than that GSO rubbish. [pl]
HE_Bracket_4AP_XboxOne_111:A corner bracket used to take up less space allowing you to attach parts for less weight than a regular block. [pl]
HE_Cab_07_XboxOne_111:A sleak pilot style cab, perfect for stealth operations. [pl]
HE_Mini_Gun_20_XboxOne_111:The "N830RC" is a six-barrel rotary machine gun with a high rate of fire, which can also fire at a high sustained rate. It features a Gatling-style set of rotating barrels with an external power source. [pl]
HE_RailGun_XboxOne_113:The long range AKIRA railgun is a relatively new addition to the arsenal. Using high-powered electromagnets, this weapon will punch a hole in just about anything, no matter how far away they are. [pl]
HE_ShotgunRotating_XboxOne_212:The Axis Shotgun is mounted on a fully rotating turret. It has a little less power than the Bayonet Shotgun, takes up more space and fires a tad slower, but makes up for it in versatility. [pl]
HE_Wheel_Single_XboxOne_121:Perfect for scout vehicles. This wheel is fast and has plenty of attach points to load up a smaller Tech with some reasonable firepower. [pl]
HE_MachineGun_33_XboxOne_111:The old faithful STEN light machine gun. A favourite for low key ops. [pl]
HE_Suppressed_Mgun_XboxOne_111:Quiet, small and minimal kickback. This is just the tool for a smaller Tech that doesn't want to be thrown around by a large weapon (or to fill up some empty spaces with some more guns). [pl]
HE_TurretRoundabout_XboxOne_111:This quad barrel launcher fires further and does more damage than the GSO one. It also rotates, it's a little slow, but it does turn. It doesn't have as many barrels, but it makes use of the ones that it has. [pl]
VENBlock_PS4_111:Light and cheap. This will make for a speedy racer - but wont stand up to punishment. [pl]
VENBooster_PS4_111:A powerful pulse booster jet in a small package.\n\nThe Little Stud Pulse Booster system was created by a Metal Machinist known as Big Will McDonald. McDonald's breakthrough came whilst working on the "Space Fill" project, the idea was to avoid polluting the Earth by forgoing landfills in favour of blasting waste materials into outer space. The original problem was the expense of the process, it simply didn't make economic sense to pay for the fuel required. However, thanks to the combined breakthroughs of Oleite self-replenishing fuel tanks and McDonald's super efficient pulse booster technology, which many have described as "beyond effective", we no longer have to worry about the vast amounts of mess and wastage we produce as a species. We're now safe in the knowledge that we can just shoot it away into space for someone else to worry about! [pl]
VENCockpit_PS4_111:Twoja standardowa kabina Venture, jak zawsze z pomarańczową przednią szybą.
VENMediumMachineGun_PS4_121:High rate of fire. Low focus. High recoil. This thing is a beast. [pl]
VENShotgunContact_PS4_111:The Venture Contact Shotgun is a powerful weapon to use at close range, but it won't work very well from a distance. [pl]
VENShotgunRotating_PS4_112:Strzelba "360" obraca się we wszystkich kierunkach. Jest słabszy niż strzelba kontaktowa i ma niższą szybkostrzelność. Ale wróg pozostanie na celowniku nie ważne dokąd zmierza!
VENStreamlineSmall_PS4_111:This streamlined small dinosaur head shaped block helps to neaten up the lines of your Venture Tech and also trades fewer Attach Points for a bit more armour. [pl]
VENTurretRoundabout_PS4_111:A twin barrel mortar launcher that can rotate all the way around and it can do it fast. Sure, these shells don't hit as hard as the GSO ones, or go quite as far, but they are much better at hitting their mark from a speeding buggy! [pl]
VENWheel_PS4_211:Small Venture wheels still leave everyone else in the dust. [pl]
EXP_Gyro_AllAxis_Active_212:A more powerful gyroscope to keep your Techs level, no matter what. This gyro is "active", meaning it will apply torque to force your Tech back to an upright position. And it's also "all axis", meaning it works in all three rotational directions. [pl]
EXP_PlasmaTeeth_311:A useful melee weapon to mount around the lower area of your Tech. It will stop anyone from getting too close by burning them with three plasma lances. Get two and flip one over to make a mean set of gnashers. [pl]
EXP_RailGunTurret_213:A more versatile Railgun fixed to a rotating turret mount. It loses some power due to the snub nosed barrel, but it makes up for it by being more likely to hit the mark. [pl]
EXP_Gyro_AllAxis_Active_222:A really heavy duty gyroscope powerful enough to correct a tilt on very large Techs. This gyro is "active", meaning it will apply torque to force your Tech back to an upright position. And it's also "all axis", meaning it works in all three rotational directions. [pl]
EXPMiniGunDual_312:What’s better than one big Auto Cannon? Two slightly smaller ones of course! These will really chew them up. [pl]
EXPMiningFlail_442:The Cat Nine Flail Guard is a great defensive tool for clearing away any bits and bobs that get too close to your wheels when mining. They're also pretty handy for keeping any troublemaking Techs from attacking you from the sides or back. [pl]
EXPMiningFlail_663:The Windmill Flail Guard is a professional version of the Cat Nine Flail Guard. A much heavier hitting tool, that can be fitted to Techs with a much higher ground clearance. [pl]
EXPNosePropBig_662:A large, powerful Nose Propeller to be used on larger aircraft. [pl]
EXPSonicLance_411:Developed by a fluidics engineer, Dr. Wren Hensgen. He was originally trying to create a new type of hydraulic trouser press, but got carried away and ended up with a sonic lance capable of launching 50 metric tons of machinery over a house. [pl]
EXPSteeringHover_212:These powerful Steering Hover units can give more air control to heavy hovering Techs. [pl]
GCBlock_444:This is a very big block. Possibly the biggest one. But that's been said before about other ones, so let's not get into that again. Anyway, this is a big one! [pl]
HE_Block_212:A tactical four pack block. Heavy, hard and tough. Just like the two block, but twice as big. [pl]
HE_Block_213:This handy six pack block helps to build larger Techs in shorter amounts of time. Stop fiddling around with those ones and twos and get on with it. [pl]
VENBlockCorner_111:A light corner block to build Techs with some more interesting streamlined shapes to them. Fancy. [pl]
VENBlockZ1_312:Did you ever play that game where you have to make neat lines of blocks in a row and they keep appearing faster and faster? Well the Z-shaped blocks were really helpful in that, right? [pl]
VENBlockZ2_312:This is just a mirrored version of the other Z-shaped block. Do we really need two awkward Z-shaped Blocks? Two of them? Seriously? [pl]
BF_Block_111:A Better Future One Block. Yep, it's a One Block, I don't know what you were hoping to find here. You know it's a One Block, we know it's a One Block. It's a One Block. [pl]
BF_Block_Faired_111:This is a One Block, but with a little hat on it. Cute huh? [pl]
BF_Block_Smooth_111:This One Block has a hat on, but no attach point on top. It's all smooth and shiny. [pl]
BF_Streamline_111:A Streamlined One Block, perfect for sloping mid sections. Joins up well with the Streamlined Corner One Block. [pl]
BF_Streamline_112:This Streamlined Two Block is good for two long sloping sections. Works well with the Streamlined Corner Two Block. [pl]
BF_Streamline_113:Good for sloping sections that are Three Blocks long. [pl]
BF_Streamline_114:You get the idea by now right? This is used for sloping mid sections that are Four Blocks long. [pl]
BF_Streamline_115:A sloping Five Block. There isn't much more to say about this. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Corner_111:A nice way to round off the corners of any sections made with the Streamlined One Block. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Corner_112:This works perfectly with the Streamlined Two Block to finish off the corners. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Corner_113:This works well to finish off the corners for the Streamlined Three Blocks. You're really into reading the descriptions of fairly standard blocks aren't you? Let's throw in a little factoid to spice things up: did you know that owls can turn their heads up to 270 degrees? Now you do. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Corner_114:Put this on the end of your sloping Streamlined Four Block sections to make them look all neat and tidy. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Corner_115:Wow, this is a really big Streamlined Corner Block - five long huh? That is really something! Hoo wee! Well, blow me over with a feather. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Corner_212:This Wide Streamlined Corner works with well with the Streamlined Two Blocks. If you want to go for that wide flatter look. It's pretty good, I guess. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Corner_L_213:These Corner Wide blocks get a bit tricky now. You'll need both a left and a right variant to round off the wide corners on a sloping Streamlined Three Block section. I know it's a pain, but what can you do? [pl]
BF_Streamline_Corner_R_213:This is the Wide Right Streamlined Corner block to match the Wide Left variant. Stick these on the edges of a Streamlined Three Block section to get that cool wide look that everyone is always going on about. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Corner_L_214:A Left Wide Four Corner Streamlined Block. That's a bit of a mouthful isn't it. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Corner_R_214:The corresponding Wide Four Right Corner Streamlined Block. You asked for it, so we delivered it! Wait… you didn't ask for it? Oh, well… here it is anyway! [pl]
BF_Streamline_Corner_L_215:I bet you never thought you'd see the day when you had a Wide Five Left Streamlined Block to call your very own. Well good for you, you deserve it. Treat yourself. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Corner_R_215:You know that old saying - "Where there's a Wide Five Left Streamlined Block, you'll probably also find a Wide Five Right Streamlined Block." Something to think about there. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Extender_122:This extender is great when used with the Wide Streamlined Blocks on their side. You can make a whole new streamlined shape and it looks just as neat as before. Boom! [pl]
BF_Streamline_Extender_123:I know what you're thinking. "Oh my gosh! they do a Streamline Extender that is Three Blocks long?" You're darn right my friend. Stick a Three Wide Corner Block on the end of this and you've got yourself something pretty special, let me tell you. [pl]
BF_Cab_212:The Better Future eCab is the ultimate in Cab only freedom. It hovers, it moves around (sort of), it even has laser guns! Pew! pew! pew! Take that other Corporations! [pl]
BF_Wheel_Small_Angled_122:An entry level Halo wheel. This is a nice slim design for nippy little Techs that want to keep a low profile. [pl]
BF_Wheel_Small_Straight_222:With a beefier wide tyre, this Halo wheel is a bit more stable than the angled one. [pl]
BF_Wheel_Small_Side_222:Very similar to the Small Straight Halo wheel, but in a handy side mounting variant so that you can build your Tech how you want it. [pl]
BF_Wheel_Medium_Straight_233:The Medium Halo wheels are fast, responsive and look awesomely futuristic. [pl]
BF_Wing_Medium_Outside_413:These are powerful, responsive wings mounted on gimbals so that the whole wing will act as a flap. [pl]
BF_Booster_111:Look at this tiny booster! It really packs a good punch though. Remember to take a Fuel Tank with you to keep your Booster stocked and ready to go when you need it in a pinch. [pl]
BF_Hover_Ring_Large_424:Look at the size of this Hover Ring. What a beauty. Just like the smaller versions, this one doesn't have built in Hover Steering, but it's one of the most powerful hovers (for its size) and it can shift the direction of the Hover Ring to give it some basic steering. [pl]
BF_Hover_Ring_Small_212:The Hover Rings are more powerful than the flipper variants. They can lift more weight with ease. Whilst they don't feature integrated directional Hover Steering jets, the hover rings are mounted on gimbals and used vectored thrusting to help steer on their own. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Extender_124:Oh boy! Another Streamlined Extender Block? This one is good to be used with the Four Wide Corner Blocks. [pl]
BF_Streamline_Extender_125:The biggest Streamlined Extender Block going. This is it, the Five! I'm in awe of it. [pl]
BF_Wheel_Medium_Side_233:A tough medium sized Halo Wheel with side mountings. [pl]
BF_Wing_Medium_Middle_413:Use this powerful Middle Wing to build flying Techs with magnificent wing spans. [pl]
BF_Wing_Small_212:A tiny little diddly wing. This works well as a tail wing, or as a wing tip for the edge bits on your awesome flying Tech. [pl]
BF_Hover_Flipper_Medium_Left_323:The Hover Flippers are great versatile hover blocks. The internal hover ring will angle itself to give you some steering, but this block also has built in Steering Hovers. Hover Tech Magazine said "If you only use one Hover Block this year, make it the Better Future Left Medium Hover Flipper." Although we recommend you use it in conjunction with the right variant too. It just works better that way. [pl]
BF_Hover_Flipper_Medium_Right_323:We're spoiling you, I know. Here we have a Right Medium Hover Flipper to go with your left one. Yeah, this one has vectored thrusting built into the internal hover ring and built-in Steering Hovers to boot. We're too good to you sometimes. [pl]
BF_Hover_Flipper_Large_Left_424:A big tough Flipper Hover. This is the Left one. Built in-steering, vectored thrusting internal hover ring. What more can I say? [pl]
BF_Hover_Flipper_Large_Right_424:The Right Large Hover Flipper is possibly even better than the Left version. I sometimes have trouble choosing though. They're both so good! [pl]
BF_FuelTank_112:A tough little fuel tank. Make sure to take one of these with you if you're using Boosters. [pl]
BF_Hover_Steering_212:A very powerful Steering Hover module. This can be built into the inside of your Tech if you plan carefully. Works great for guiding your ungrounded Techs through the air. [pl]
BF_Hover_Steering_111:The entry level Steering Hover. This will help you steer your ungrounded Techs with a bit more ease. [pl]
BF_Hover_Steering_112:The mid-range Steering Hover, a good all rounder. Just like the others, this one can be built into your Tech to hide it away. [pl]
BF_IonDrive_Small_112:Much like the propellers offered by other corporations, the Ion Drive requires no power or fuel to function. It works well for helping your ungrounded Techs get off the ground and keep it that way indefinitely. It also has an awesome blue trail. [pl]
BF_IonDrive_Medium_212:This is a great upgrade from the Small Ion Drive. Again, this one doesn't need power or fuel. It works very much like a propeller, but the sleek design opens up a whole new world of building options. [pl]
BF_Fin_116:This is just for looks, but what looks it offers! Wanna add mecha style 'bunny ear' bits to your Tech? Here you go! Need an awesome tail thing to finish off your hover jet powered flying whale tank? Here you go! [pl]
BF_Gyro_AllAxis_Active_111:This Active All Axis Gyro is great at stabilising hover craft and air craft Techs. It will apply torque in all directions to keep your Tech level. Do you just need to keep something upright? Use this. [pl]
BF_AGE_111:This is a Better Future block.
BF_Block_112:This Two Block is so great. Look at it. It's like two One Blocks, but stuck together. Nice!
BF_Block_113:This Three Block weighs less than three One Blocks, but it's just as tough. Save some weight and use these multiple blocks! 
BF_Block_114:This Four Block is lighter than four individual One Blocks would be. Use this one instead if you need to fill that space. It's just as tough too.
BF_Block_115:A Five Block that weighs less than five individual One Blocks? Awesome! And it's as strong as all those One Blocks would be combined? Cool.
BF_Chassis_212:Chassis Blocks are very light and very strong. Use these to fill up the empty space on the inside of a Tech instead of big heavy One Blocks.
BF_Chassis_312:Chassis Blocks are very light and very strong. Use these to fill up the empty space on the inside of a Tech instead of big heavy One Blocks.
BF_Chassis_313:Chassis Blocks are very light and very strong. Use these to fill up the empty space on the inside of a Tech instead of big heavy One Blocks.
BF_Chassis_314:Chassis Blocks are very light and very strong. Use these to fill up the empty space on the inside of a Tech instead of big heavy One Blocks.
BF_Laser_112:The Better Future Laser Rifle is a powerful and fast firing laser weapon with no kickback at all. There are very few downsides to this weapon. It's a bit expensive, but worth the price.
BF_Skid_133:This Landing Gear Skid will raise and lower automatically when your Tech lifts off or lands. It just works!
BF_Skid_143:Phwoarrr! Look at this Landing Gear Skid, isn't it great that it goes up and down on its own? Nice!
BF_Skid_254:This is a really big Landing Gear Skid. You could use it on a massive flying Tech. That would really be something sweet.
BF_Light_112:A nice streamlined Light. It fits in well with the Streamlined Two Blocks.
BF_Laser_Streamlined_112:A fast firing and powerful streamlined laser weapon. Pew pew pew pew pew pew!
BF_AirBrake_211:The Air Brake is mainly used for un-grounded Techs (hovercraft, planes, helicopters etc.), It will provide passive braking in a given direction when no input is detected. In other words, it'll slow you down when you stop driving, but only in the direction it is facing.
BF_AntiGravityEngine_111:This Anti-gravity Engine (AGE) requires power to function. Once working, it will reduce the effects of gravity on the attached Blocks within its area of influence. This is only a small one, great for starting out, it will reduce gravity by half on its Blocks, for greater reductions in gravity and areas of influence you'll want a larger one. Make sure to use gyros, hovers, props, wings and boosters to maintain control of your Tech with reduced gravity.
BF_AntiGravityEngine_212:This AGE reduces the effects of gravity on the attached Blocks within its area of influence. This one is more powerful than the Pip Engine, reducing gravity by two thirds on its Blocks, it also has a larger area of influence, but it also consumes more power to use. You can double AGEs up to reduce gravity even further all the way down to zero gravity.
BF_Booster_112:A solid mid-range Booster, it's not as powerful as something from Venture, but it doesn't drain your fuel as fast either.
BF_Control_HoverPower_111:Use the radial menu on this Block to switch all the Hovers on your Tech on or off, you can even adjust their power output to hover higher or lower in the air.
BF_Control_Killswitch_111:This Switch can control multiple Block types on your Tech, allowing them to be turned on or off. This Switch can be used for Anti-gravity Engines, Hovers, Shield Bubbles, Repair Bubbles.
BF_FuelTank_111:A compact little Fuel Tank, remember to bring lots of these if you want to use your Boosters.
BF_Gyro_AllAxis_Passive_111:This Passive Gyroscope does not apply torque to keep your Tech upright, only resistance to movements around all rotational axes. Active Gyros apply torque, meaning they will pick you up if you fall over, but passive gyros just make it harder to fall over in the first place, making your Tech more stable without impacting your control of it as much. Passive Gyros also behave differently depending on their placement on your Tech. Depending on the offset to the centre of gravity this Gyro will affect some axes more than others.
BF_Gyro_SingleAxis_Active_112:This Active Single Axis Gyro apply torque to keep your Tech upright, but only along one axis. For example, if you want to make a motorcycle that will not fall over sideways, but it still able to pull dank wheelies, this is the Gyro for you.
BF_Gyro_SingleAxis_Trim_Active_221:The Trim Gyro is technically an Active Single Axis Gyro (like the one that's good for motorcycles) but it also allows you to set an offset angle for the Gyro to tilt your Tech to. Attach it and access its radial menu to switch the Trim feature on or off, whilst on you can adjust the pitch angle at which it will attempt to hold your Tech in the air. This enables you to make diagonal builds that sit at the angle you want them to or make awesome flying Techs that keep an aggressive nose down posture.
BF_Laser_Gatling_423:A high power, fast firing Gatling Laser Cannon hidden behind a streamlined panel. You can pack some real firepower without messing up the clean minimalistic lines of your Tech.
BF_Laser_Streamlined_113:The Speed Lance Laser is strong and versatile weapon. It has a wide arc of fire and deals a good amount of damage.
BF_MotionEngine_Linear_112:The Linear Motion Engine does exactly what you'd expect, it provides throttled motion along a linear axis with the use of Anti-gravity technology. It'll lift your Tech up and down, left and right or forwards and back with a set of your throttle so no need to feather the controls. These are a great movement Block to use for Anti-gravity Techs.
BF_MotionEngine_Rotational_311:This is simply two Linear Motions Engines arranged in a Catherine Wheel formation. It will give continuous throttled rotational movement (torque) via Anti-gravity technology. Use these to make something spin indefinitely (or until it runs out of power). These are a fun way to rotate your Anti-gravity Techs.
BF_Stabiliser_Computer_111:This clever little computer will help you stay in once place when you stop driving most types of ungrounded Techs (hovercraft, helicopters and anti-gravity craft, not so much for planes though). When you stop driving, this computer will take over and steer your Hover Plates, Adjustment Thrusters and Propellers to try to keep you in one place and stop you from drifting around out of control.
BF_AirBrake_311:The Air Brake is mainly used for un-grounded Techs (hovercraft, planes, helicopters etc.), It will provide passive braking in a given direction when no input is detected. In other words, it'll slow you down when you stop driving, but only in the direction it is facing.
