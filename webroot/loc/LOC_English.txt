The blueprints were uncovered years later and applied to the 19th Edition Foreman Cab though he himself was never found. The new cabs now look like a penthouse with a built in pool and contain cup holders, finally. The cab is banned in over 3000 planets due to workers slacking off and is referred to as "Huston" by GeoCorp on those planets. Most haven't caught on to the code word yet.

After the Third Singularity War, sanctions were finally put in place to ban the development of sentient synthetics. However, the market demands that a drone be smarter and more helpful than its predecessors and so Champion - Development Manager of Magneto Robotics, has darted back and forth over the line of brilliance and recklessness in his pursuit of a smarter A.I. Some call him a pioneer of the craft, as one of the forefront of creators who are willing to push things forward and others question his policy of testing dangerously autonomous units in the lawless frontiers of off-world mining colonies.
GSOAlternator_111:The Alternator Conveyor is a special type of Conveyor that will send the items that reach it alternating different directions.

GSOConveyor_111:A standard conveyor. It moves things around any circuit you create.\n\nProfessor Le Rouge (P.A.N. da) was the original inventor of the conveyor technology for the Nosey Construction Company used in many automated off-world strip mining operations. After seeing the mass deforestation that his creations had indirectly enabled, he was distraught. In that moment he renounced his earlier career. He now spends all his time as an eco activist - spreading awareness of the plight of the red pandas (for which he has a particular love) that have been displaced by the relentless destruction of off-world mining programs.

GSODeliCannon_222:Delivery Cannons sell unwanted items back to Earth earning money. This one is static, it will only work whilst anchored.\n\nLow orbital interplanetary relay (LOIR) is a method was pioneered by Dr. Bernard Steen. Steen developed the process to smuggle controlled substances from one planet to another with efficiency and anonymity. On the ground a 'Delivery Cannon' is loaded with the object one wishes to send. It then blasts the payload into low orbit where a radio-controlled relay satellite collects it and sends it on the desired trajectory through space to its destination. Steen was eventually caught by the authority. He avoided prison by striking a deal to "share" the process with off-world mining corporations and interplanetary postal services. He even receives a 1% cut from the profit of each item that is sent. He currently splits his time between Titan and Mars as a tax-exile.
GSODropperConveyor_111:This manufacturing block can be attached to any conveyor to let the held chunk be picked off and dropped onto the floor.
GSOFabricator_322:Fabricators take two or more resource chunks and craft them into a block.\n\nThe GSO Fabricator was first devised by Dr. Lawrence Hartley during his work on the Good Day Project. The original inspiration for the Fabricator came from a vintage sci-fi TV show, aired in the late 20th century, in this show a device called a 'Replicator' could make any food instantly from pure energy. Dr.'s Hartley and Phuquestayne saw the potential applications for a real replication device and began work on this project together. Their labour soon bore fruit in the form of a prototype device that they dubbed, the Fabricator. Operators could combine different materials in this machine and it would produce something completely new.

GSOFuelTank_121:A small fuel tank to supply the boosters.\n\nWhat lessons can be learned from the fateful Icarus XIII mission? Captain Jack "Nosey" Pledger gained notoriety early in his career as a pioneer in high altitude flight, and incredible ingenuity, by winning the regional Deben Valley Sumo Tech Championships. Icarus XIII's black box recorder shows that the cause of the failure was forgetting to fill the fuel tanks before the second leg take off. The ship reached low orbit before cutting out and leaving the crew plummeting to their doom. Since then, the introduction of Oleite self-replenishing technologies as seen in all modern fuel tanks have ensured that this kind of tragedy will never happen again.

You can also access the blocks and get them back from said dimension with the inventory in build beam mode. Surely there must be some other applications for this technology? This one only works whilst anchored.
GSOHover_212:A large hover plate. From the future!
GSOHoverJet_111:Small hover plates to reduce friction and keep your Techs floating.\n\nDr. Daryl Titcomb, a marine electronics engineer, confirmed hydrophobe and self-styled anti-gravity bender, developed the first early prototypes of the technology we now use in hover plates. His initial intention was to develop a mode of transportation over water that would not involve touching it (because it's gross). After a serious injury incurred by trying to use monkfish as a superconductor, Titcomb's arch nemesis - Sir John John Johnson the Third attempted to steal his plans for the hover technology. The dispute over who would lay claim to authorship of the technology was eventually decided by duel. Lucky for Titcomb, his skills learned as an avid historical battle reenactor granted him the upper hand, Sir Johnson was swiftly dispatched and Titcomb reclaimed his legacy.
GSOLaserFixed_111:Small pew pew pew laser guns. You'll need a few of them to make an impact.\n\nProfessor Yum of the Personal Technology Institute (P-Tech, i-USA), happened upon the Narrow Gauge COIL Laser technology whilst attempting to pioneer a range of ion laser cookery ovens. The idea was to develop a faster method of cooking than conventional microwave ovens. Early tests were plagued with mishaps as the food being heated had a habit of charging with unstable kinetic energy. In one case Yum reportedly threw a piece of bacon at a target after exposure, the bacon turned red in the air and summarily exploded upon impact. The technology has since been repurposed for the defence industry, after a significant reduction in power.
GSOLaserForward_111:This is a moderately powerful laser front facing stud fixing.
GSOLightFixed_111:A sleek rocket shaped headlight. A design classic that will endure for all ages.\n\nThe final performance by infamous poet, Jock Silver was for an off-world jamboree. A giant stage was constructed and lined with footlights that lit his every move upon the boards, the audience gathered, the curtains were drawn and Silver took the stage for one last time. He entranced the crowd at once, flipping back and forth, bamboozling them with his nimble verse. The crowd was transfixed and enthralled until one prospector noticed Silver's accomplice - Noah Webster was busy stealing, scrapping and selling all of their Techs from the parking area. Silver had been distracting the crowd to cover the caper. So goes the story of the final performance of Jock Silver, as neither he nor Webster was ever heard from again.
GSOLightSpot_111:The searchlight will scan around and automatically focus on nearby enemies to stop them sneaking up on you.\n\nThe off-world frontier is a lawless place. A few lawmen do try to tame the lands. World Police Officer - Mathieu Choiniere. Officer Choiniere is among them, started his off-world career as an engineer when a gang of legion harvester rustlers rolled through his settlement stealing Techs as they went, he was deputised into a posse. After tracking the rustlers, the posse settled in for the night. Little did they know the rustlers were creeping up on their camp to ambush it under the cover of night. Were it not for the watchful eyes of Choiniere and his trusty spotlight, those rustlers may have got the drop on the posse. Choiniere is now a lawman in his own right.

At the outbreak of the first Gamma Quadrant War (GQW1), Kempton-Bass joined the Stella-Royal Marines Commandos Regiment. During the conflict, Kempton-Bass notched up over 300 confirmed kills and lost his mind. After the war, he retired to his undersea lair and began tinkering on various projects to keep himself amused. The ZK-47 was originally created, whilst trying to find a low-cost alternative to text messages. However, the GSO in its wisdom saw other applications for the Kempykov.
GSOMiniMissile_222:The GSO Missile Battery really brings the pain. Four lock-on missiles can be launched from this pod in quick succession.

Although Core-Sample has stated that their original purpose was to protect dig sites and trenches from outside tampering or adverse weather. Core-Sample now lives an enigmatic lifestyle in his temple-like home (behind layers of Bubble Shields) where he, "pretends to be normal." Critics claim that he is just a disgruntled old hermit, but he refutes these claims, stating: "I hate it when other people assume or suggest that I am disgruntled. I am always totally gruntled!"

The team behind the S.Y.L.V.E.R. project stirred up deep concerns after announcing that their learning computer had achieved singularity. Fortunately rather than pursuing a goal of obliterating mankind, the self-aware S.Y.L.V.E.R. entity instead seemed more interested in designing and crafting powerful high-end Blocks. Dr Praz, a developer on the project, realised the obvious practical application and the project was converted into a Fabricator.

SPEColourBlock01_Black_111:A colour block for making pretty patterns.
SPEColourBlock02_Grey_111:A colour block for making pretty patterns.\n\nSomni the Grey rests in Hyper Sleep. An ancient member of the Order of Colour Alchemists, Somni arises once hundred years to tend to experiments. Somni has forsaken all else in their search for the new colour, his life has been extended far beyond the natural life of a human. Family and friends are long forgotten memories. Although the alchemist is still in debt for the bionic augmentations that keep him alive, the small interest they accrue in his BB account will cover the costs in millennia or two, he need only sleep on and be patient.

VENAIGuardModule_111:This A.I. module is great for building scouts.
VENAltimeter_111:How high are we flying? Don't know? Then this Altimeter is just the thing for you. It tells you how far above sea level it is. What sea? You know, 'the' sea. It's also a slick nose cone shape to go on the front of your plane.
VENAnchorFixed_111:This is a Venture Fixed Anchor, for all you Venture fans who love to make fixed bases… have fun!
VENAnchorRotating_111:This is the fastest turning Rotating Anchor available. Just don't expect it to carry too much weight though. It's a great choice for light defence turrets that need to target fast moving targets.
VENBattery_111:A small capacity battery but very light and less explosive too.
VENBlock_111:Light and cheap. This will make for a speedy racer - but wont stand up to punishment.
VENBlock_112:Very much like a slightly longer version of the normal Venture block.
VENBlockSkirting_121:These odd blocks are used to fill in the gaps when building an anchored, walled base. They can be used all over the place. What they lack in Attach Points, they make up for in armour.
VENBooster_111:A powerful pulse booster jet in a small package.\n\nThe Little Stud Pulse Booster system was created by a Metal Machinist known as Big Will McDonald. McDonald's breakthrough came whilst working on the "Space Fill" project, the idea was to avoid polluting the Earth by forgoing landfills in favour of blasting waste materials into outer space. The original problem was the expense of the process, it simply didn't make economic sense to pay for the fuel required. However, thanks to the combined breakthroughs of Oleite self-replenishing fuel tanks and McDonald's super efficient pulse booster technology, which many have described as "beyond effective", we no longer have to worry about the vast amounts of mess and wastage we produce as a species. We're now safe in the knowledge that we can just shoot it away into space for someone else to worry about!
VENBoosterDouble_211:Radical! What's better than one booster? Two Boosters! Two Double Boosters, no wait, that would be four boosters, this is one double booster, two jets in total. Let's not get carried away.
VENBracketRightAngle_111:A right angle bracket piece. A sturdy and lightweight solution for when you want to stick that thing on the side.
VENBracketStraight_111:A simple lighweight bracket with an Attach Point at each end. This is just the thing for keeping the strength up and the weight down.
VENBracketStraight_211:A longer variant of the straight bracket.\n\nThough rather humble at first glance, the introduction of brackets has revolutionised many Tech designers' output. Brackets were first introduced by Professor Ruin, of the Idont Institute in the Western Americadia Republic. Their genius is their simplicity, Ruin saw that if he stripped away all of the unnecessary bulk and weight, a much stronger superstructure could be created that just provided people with raw attach points linked by strong high density metals. Ruin originally devised them for the construction of land train style Techs. Since then, their use has stretched far and wide being favoured particularly by quadcopter fanatics and Venture dirt bike racers. Ruin is recently recovering from an allergic reaction to medication he was taking for his heart condition, he is said to be out of the woods and making a strong recovery.
VENBracketUShape_111:A U shaped bracket. A lightweight alternative to including a whole block. Pretty strong too!
VENCockpit_111:Your standard Venture cab. Comes with orange windscreen.\n\nBuilding upon his earlier successes with the Venture bracket system, Prof. Ruin of the Idont Institut tackled a much more complex project when he was approached again by Venture to devise an all-terrain Cab that could operate independently at high speeds under testing conditions. Prof. Ruin's POD Cab was a roaring success. The nippy little thing handles dunes and mountains with ease and is fast enough to make a quick exit when needed. It also comes equipped with a built-in PIP rifle, the little brother of the popular Venture Hail Fire. Ruin also had plans to include built-in missile launchers and a radar, but alas, they proved too expensive for the Venture brief. Ruin's next project for Venture is still a closely guarded secret, although insider reports have revealed that the project's codename is "The Tower".
VENConveyor_111:A Venture Conveyor can hold and pass chunks along to other connected conveyors or manufacturing blocks.
VENDeliCannon_221:The Mobile Delivery Cannon can sell chunks whilst on the move on a mobile Tech, making it much easier to earn money.
VENEnclosedProp_113:The Zero is a small and powerful propeller with 9 attach points. It's a fairly expensive, but the small size and good power mean they can stack to help give some of the best force for their size, if you can afford them.
VENFabricator_322:This Venture Fabricator will allow you to craft Venture blocks from resource chunks.
VENFlameThrower_121:This Flamethrower is great for showing off to your friends whilst doing wheelies. It's not much good for, you know, fighting or mining or anything.\n\nMany say that Dr. Lawrence Hartley was a deeply changed man following the demise of this collegue-come-rival Dr. Dick Phuquestayne following their completion of the Fabricator project. Hartley stepped down as chair of the Good Day Project and returned with his family to his native Canada. During this stage in his career, he turned away from inventions for the good of mankind and instead, to the surprise of many began work on weapons technologies. His efforts included the so called the 'Fusion Toothbrush', which would explode 30 seconds after it was turned on and the Reaper X1 Flamethrower, a devastating pyrotechnic weapon that he sold to the Venture corporation. Recent rumours suggest that he has turned a corner and may be in talks to take up his position at the Good Day Project once again.
VENFrontWing_311:This thing makes your Tech look like an F1 car and works as a spoiler.
VENFuelPod_111:A very small Fuel Tank with a surprisingly large capacity and price tag.
VENFuelTank_212:A highly compressed fuel tank which will refill relatively quickly too.
VENGyro_AllAxis_Active_111:This gyro is excellent for stabilising aircraft that are tricky to fly or for building unstable Techs with two legs or one wheel or whatever. If you have enough of these things, they will hold anything up. This gyro is "active", meaning it will apply torque to force your Tech back to an upright position. And it's also "all axis", meaning it works in all three rotational directions.\n\n***Breaking News*** Molecular biologist, Dr. Chrii Von Vieh of the Germland Institute in Scotmany, noted inventor of the Plasma Cutter & Gyro Rotor, has been sectioned under the mental health act. Dr. Chrii is said to be suffering from delusions and mania. Aides close to the renowned doctor reported receiving severe dressing downs if they failed to address the doctor by "his proper title" - "Lemon Lord, Amber Eminence". The doctor claimed to be a "Royal Advisor" to "The Lemon King". The situation escalated on Tuesday afternoon when during a dispute over lab equipment in the Germland Space Institute, Dr. Chrii attacked a colleague by pinning him down and squeezing a blood orange into his eyes. The Von Vieh family have said that Dr. Chrii has been overworked for months but is now stable and just requires rest. They expect him to make a full recovery in time.
VENHoverPlate_211:The Venture Zero G Plate will provide unlimited propulsion in a given direction, which is great - but it can't be switched off either. Which is not so great.
VENLandingGear_111:A wheel enclosed in a casing with a side and top attach point.
VENLightFixed_111:A rally-style headlight in a rugged casing that will handle the knocks and bumps of the trail with ease.
VENLightSpot_111:The perfect choice for night time adventures and battles. This small but powerful searchlight will auto-lock onto passing enemies.
VENLightStrip_211:The ultra-thin lightbar can be mounted on the underside of Techs to add an awesome under-glow.
VENLightStud_111:These bright orange light emitting diodes are an excellent and efficient choice for lighting your Tech on night adventures.
VENMediumMachineGun_121:High rate of fire. Low focus. High recoil. This thing is a beast.
VENMGun_111:A great starter machine gun. High rate of fire. Poor accuracy.
VENMGun_112:High rate of fire and medium range. A reliable - if under-powered weapon.
VENMobileSCU_221:This SCU Storage Device can be used whilst on the move, it does not need to be anchored. It does take a little bit longer to pick things up and has a shorter range than the anchored one, but it's still pretty convenient.
VENNoseProp_331:A sturdy front mounted propeller.
VENPropSmall_111:A small, modestly priced entry level propeller. Perfect for a budding flight enthusiast's first foray into the open skies. Or useful to bulk up the power and use up any spare space on a larger aircraft.
VENRadar_111:The Venture radar helps scouts avoid larger enemies.
VENReceiver_111:A Venture Resource Receiver can hold and pass chunks even at higher speeds, but it only has a stack height of 1 - which isn't very many.
VENRefinery_212:This refinery changes raw resources into refined ones. It's also mobile, you don't need to have it anchored in order to use it.
VENRegen_111:This repair bubble is small but heals fast and has a low power drain.
VENRemoteCharger_111:A Venture remote charger that can transfer stored energy from one Tech to any other allied one with a battery. Short range, fast arc speed and low arc power.
VENRPGLauncher_122:The Avalanche Launcher fires short range lock-on missiles. As long as you're in range, these missiles will hit their mark.
VENScrapper_212:A Venture Scrapper, reduces Venture blocks to their component resources.
VENShield_111:This shield bubble is small, but has a good amount of soak and a low drain on power.\n\nBitMage is a wandering false prophet and con artist. One unlucky sap that fell foul of his schemes was Theus_TM, a close friend of the assassination android known as MurderBot. MurderBot and Theus chased BitMage all the way back to his shanty shack with every intention of breaking BitMage into tiny pieces. But BitMage made it back just in time to throw up his trusty shield projector. The generator then promptly broke and the shield quit. BitMage heard the squeak of wheels lurching forward. In desperation, BitMage gave the generator a tremendous kick, and it spluttered back to life shooting the shield back up, before failing again. But, Murderbot had surged forward and got caught mid-beam, splitting him neatly in two.
VENShotgunContact_111:The Venture Contact Shotgun is a powerful weapon to use at close range, but it won't work very well from a distance.
VENSilo_212:A medium sized mix silo. This one will take multiple types of chunks at a time.
VENSpeedometer_111:This little gizmo will add a speedo to the HUD. You can see how fast you're going now.
VENSteeringHover_111:The Venture 5-Way Adjustment Thruster is a great block for attempting to control Techs in the air, it will enable tilting and rolling. It's also good for steering hover Techs.
VENSteeringHoverBi_111:The Venture 2-Way Adjustment Thruster is a great block for adding precision controls to a hover or flying Tech in a single axis only. Unlike the 5-way version, this block lets you limit the exact direction of force along one axis.
VENSteeringHoverSingle_111:The Venture 1-Way Adjustment Thruster is a great block for adding precision controls to a hover or flying Tech in a single direction only. Unlike the 5-way version, this block lets you limit the exact direction of force.
VENStreamlineCorner_111:This streamlined hooked beak shaped corner block helps to neaten up the lines of your Venture Tech and also trades fewer Attach Points for a bit more armour.
VENStreamlineLarge_131:This streamlined large dinosaur head shaped block helps to neaten up the lines of your Venture Tech and also trades fewer Attach Points for a bit more armour.
VENStreamlineLargeAlt_131:This streamlined duck bill shaped block helps to neaten up the lines of your Venture Tech and also trades fewer Attach Points for a bit more armour.
VENStreamlineMed_121:This streamlined medium dinosaur head shaped block helps to neaten up the lines of your Venture Tech and also trades fewer Attach Points for a bit more armour.
VENStreamlineSmall_111:This streamlined small dinosaur head shaped block helps to neaten up the lines of your Venture Tech and also trades fewer Attach Points for a bit more armour.
VENTerminal_111:This Venture Payload Terminal can be used to buy all sorts of Venture blocks, and other blocks too.
VENTractor_111:This Collector will not hold many resource chunks, but it will hold on to the ones that it takes tightly, even at high speeds.
VENWheel_111:The most compact high performance off-road wheel around. Very nippy motors that may be a bit tricky for newer explorers to handle. These will get you from A to B in no time at all.
VENWheel_211:Small Venture wheels still leave everyone else in the dust.
VENWheel_222:Large Venture wheels are strong and fast.\n\nThe Venture Springer Wheel is brought to you by hyper athlete and motor sports legend Florian Gamper. The renowned German Track and Field Champion said of the new all terrain wheel; 'the attention to detail that's gone into this design is impeccable'. The all seasons, wave riding captain added 'Venture really push their engineers to the limit to get optimal performance out of their wheels'. The self confessed day dream believer added 'getting stuck in the slow lane is for neo-broccoli boys, for real power, go with Venture'.
VENWheel_Monster_444:The Daddy! This thing is insane. HUUUUUGE Balloon tyres with deep tractor treads. These things are the way up there in all terrain power and speed. They can carry a fair amount too.
VENWheel_Single_A_223:A mid set alternative to the Springer wheel. Boing!
VENWheel_Single_C_223:A short angled fork version of the Springer wheel. Wheeeee!
VENWheel_Single_D_224:A long angled fork version of the Springer wheel. Go!
VENWheel_Sports1_Left_112:This Dune Wheel is very similar to a Globe Trotter, but with an added fender to keep the dust down and an extra attach point on top.
VENWheel_Sports1_Right_112:This Dune Wheel is very similar to a Globe Trotter, but with an added fender to keep the dust down and an extra attach point on top.
VENWheel_Titan_666:The REAL Daddy! Words can't describe the awesomness of this balloon tyre with deep tractor treads. These things are the ultimate in all terrain power and speed. They can carry a fair amount too.
VENWing_322:For your inner boy racer. This will keep you grounded at high speeds.
VENWingAngledLeft_423:Rudder Tipped Wings have both horizontal and vertical flaps, adding to stability and versatility for minimalist plane designs and enabling grander aircraft an extra free set of tail wing-style vertical rudders.
VENWingAngledRight_423:Rudder Tipped Wings have both horizontal and vertical flaps, adding to stability and versatility for minimalist plane designs and enabling grander aircraft an extra free set of tail wing-style vertical rudders.
VENWingExpanderLeft_413:A left Venture expander wing.
VENWingExpanderRight_413:A right Venture expander wing.
VENWingMiddle_312:A wing section that can be used to make a wider wingspan and give more lift to a flying Tech.
VENWingSmall_211:For a more discerning boy racer - less garish… right?
VENWingTail_122:A Venture tail wing.
VENWingTiny_111:This small spoiler is perfect for providing a bit of down force on a small scout vehicle. It also has 3 Attach Points - what a treat!
EXP_Hover_424:The largest and highest floating hover platform available. This makes for a perfect perch to rain down fire from above, just so long as you can control where it drifts.
EXPCannonRepulsor_444:The Repulsor Cannon is a ground-to-air anti-aircraft weapon that fires an electro-magnetic charge which generates a repulsion pulse when they collide with their target. These pulses cause low damage to the target, but have very high impulse force, which knock most flying Techs off-course making it very difficult to continue flying once hit. This weapon can only be placed in an upright orientation.
EXPFlamethrowerPlasma_112:The flame on this thing is blue! BLUE! Do you know how hot blue fire is? No? Neither do I… but it's definitely hotter than that rubbish orange fire. Yeah, once you use blue fire, you're not going to want to mess around with that orange stuff anymore. What's the point?
GCBuzzSaw_246:The GeoCorp Buzz Saw is mainly used for cutting trees in half. The Excavator is the next step up in the series. This tool is mainly used for cutting planets in half. Yes. That's right. A planet! Oh look! You can plug it in with a regular household plug too. You don't need one of those special power tool ones, that's handy.
GCHover_222:GeoCorp, making a Hover Plate? But they don't have any way to steer it… or propel it… But look at the size of this thing! Do you know how much it can lift? No? Neither do I, but I bet that it's a lot! Oh boy!
GCPlasmaCutter_Auto_434:This gimbal mounted Plasma cutter is a great tool for zapping those hard to reach resources. Oh wait, for some reason it locks onto target other Techs? Well that's odd… I'm sure they'll sort out that bug out with a firmware update later. Anyway, although you gain in freedom of movement, it is a little less potent in the power department, but it has a slightly longer range than other Plasma Cutters to make up for it.
GSOMegatonLong_242:Roughly twice as powerful as the Megaton Cannon, but fires at half the speed. This cannon is bigger, heavier and tougher, but boy, does it go with a bang!
HE_Battery_211:A heavy duty battery pack with a ruggedised casing that can handle more than a few knocks. Much more sturdy than any other battery for its size. This baby ain't cheap, or light, but it stores more than double the capacity of that GSO rubbish and it also comes it this awesome stealth black design. Sure, the LEDs make it a little less stealthy, but yeah.
HE_CannonBattleship_216:The heaviest ballistic weapon currently licensed for use in off-world colonies. This battleship class gun has an incredibly long range and high power. It will not rotate, so whatever weapons platform you attach it to will need to do most of the aiming. But when it is on target it will really make a mess. These super heavyweight ballistics take a long time to reload too, so make sure it's on target when pressing the fire button.
HE_LaserZeus_222:The eggheads in the lab have finally managed to produce this energy weapon that we can mount to a full rotation turret. This aint your average laser pointer, it will really ruin your day if you shine it into your eyes.
HE_Mortar_232:Listen up Meatheads! This is the one you've been waiting for. A heavy payload fixed mortar launcher. This baby isn't the fastest firing mortar, but it has a long reach and it will really ruin someone's day when the shell hits them.
HE_TurretRoundabout_111:This quad barrel launcher fires further and does more damage than the GSO one. It also rotates, it's a little slow, but it does turn. It doesn't have as many barrels, but it makes use of the ones that it has.
HE_WheelLarge_244:The Big Daddy! Faster and tougher than the GeoCorp Big Boy. It's not got as much torque and can't shift as much weight. But If you're looking for the right wheels for a battle-ready Tech, this is what you need.
HE_WheelMid_233:The armoured Warhorse. These wheels are tougher and faster than anything GeoCorp make in this size. Sure they can't carry as much, but they're built for combat, not for lugging junk around.
VENCannonRapid_313:A lightweight, fast firing heavy armament. This twin barrel cannon can outpace a Megaton in rate of fire and range, although it is let down slightly in the damage and blast radius departments. Still a solid bit of kit.
VENDropper_111:This manufacturing block can be attached to any conveyor to let the held chunk be picked off and dropped onto the floor.
VENFilter_111:Connect this filter to a conveyor loop. Imprint it with an item by dragging the item on top of it. Once imprinted it will filter that item out from the rest.
VENLaserMachineGun_112:This fast firing NEEDLE laser will chip away at its target with a furious rain of laser bolts. It can't rotate all the way around, so you'll need to position it manually. It also gets pretty hot when it's been firing for a while, so no touchy!
VENLaserTurret_111:They said it couldn't be done. A laser weapon mounted to a rotating turret? "Nah, can't be done" said the boffins at GSO and Hawkeye. Well look who cracked it - Venture! Sure, it's lost a bit of power in the production process, but the trade off for a wider range of attack is worth it, right? Oh darn, it doesn't tilt up and down very much… Hmmm.
VENMachineGunForward_311:The Crossfire is a fixed mid-range rifle that packs more of a punch than the Hail Fire, but has a slower rate of fire. It also needs to be aimed directly at the target to connect as it is not gimbal mounted.
VENTracks_112:A fast and grippy off-road track, great for taking rough terrain at speed. Less good for carrying heavy weight or damage.
VENTracks_124:A beefy off-road track built for speed over rough terrain. Not the toughest under fire and it wasn't made to carry a heavy burden, but it will get you through the trickiest inclines, at speed, with ease.
VENTurretRoundabout_111:A twin barrel mortar launcher that can rotate all the way around and it can do it fast. Sure, these shells don't hit as hard as the GSO ones, or go quite as far, but they are much better at hitting their mark from a speeding buggy!
HE_ArmourPlate_111:This Small Armour Plate is tougher than the GSO one, but it's also more expensive and heavier.\n\nThis armour plating was developed by Dr. D. Noaksey, a biologist of the Independent Game and Fisheries Advocates Association. He originally wanted to build frog armour to save an endangered species from becoming roadkill. The discovery and implementation of aggregated carbon nanorods that Dr. Noaksey developed, allowed the minerals to be put into a state of a temporal flux making it a pliable material to allow its application to a surface to increase its defensive structure, making it possible to fabricate small armoured suits for the rare Green Peppered Frog to wear which were flexible enough for the frog to move around in and could withstand the pressure of having a tank rolled over them.
HE_ArmourPlate_211:This Medium Armour Plate is tougher than the GSO one, but it's also more expensive and heavier.
HE_ArmourPlate_221:This Large Armour Plate is tougher than the GSO and GeoCorp ones, but it's also more expensive.
HE_ArmourPlate_Extended_221:The Notch Armour Plate is tougher than the GSO and GeoCorp ones of a similar size, but it's also more expensive. It also includes an Attach Point on the outside to mount extra weapons to.
HE_ShotgunRotating_212:The Axis Shotgun is mounted on a fully rotating turret. It has a little less power than the Bayonet Shotgun, takes up more space and fires a tad slower, but makes up for it in versatility.
VENShotgunRotating_112:The 360 Shotgun rotates in all directions. It's less powerful than the Contact Shotgun and has a lower rate of fire. But it will stay on target no matter where the enemy goes.
GSOBigBertha_845:A 420mm M-Grade Gun. Technically a naval class weapon, but you can mount it on anything that's big enough to carry it.\n\nOf German origin, the gun was mainly designed by SRQ Technologies Director of Design, Senior Ra'Gequi. It can fire a 820kg high explosive shell roughly 8 miles.
VENMicroMissile_112:This battery launches six micro-missiles into a swarming cluster that will home-in on any nearby targets. Fly my pretties! Fly!
GCBooster_422:This giant booster has a built in fuel tank. It’s designed to help Techs of the larger persuasion to get over those bumps or hills when they’re struggling under their own weight.
VENHydraulicRamSmall_111:Developed by a fluidics engineer, Dr. Wren Hensgen. He was originally trying to create a new type of hydraulic trouser press, but got carried away and ended up with a hydraulic ram capable of launching 50 metric tons of machinery over a house.
GCFlail_446:The GeoCorp TB Thresher combines a flail/grinder with a collector. It's a great tool for harvesting and collecting resources all in one combined block. The original prototype for this block was developed by Mr T. Bear, although his blueprint was for a much smaller GSO model. GeoCorp saw the potential and took the project on, beefing the unit up significantly and got it to market first.
GC_BigPete_Consumer_222:Om nom nom nom nom nom!
GSOMGunFixed_111_EC:The ZK-50X is an upgraded version of the Kempykov. Fit for the modern battlefield.
GSOCannonTurret_111_EC:A more advanced cannon turret than the 3-Pounder. Packs a knockout punch.
GCPlasmaCutter_Angled_222_EC:An industrial grade, heavy mining tool using cutting edge focused photon beam technology.
GCArticulatedDrill_423_EC:An articulated drill grinder with very dense crystal tips. This is the deluxe model reserved for serious tradespeople only.
VENFlameThrower_PS4_122:The X2 is a generous upgrade from the X1 model. This Flamethrower is perfect for summer BBQs around the pool or for scorched-earth warfare tactics.
VENMgun_PS4_112:A new twist on an old classic. I heard they only made 50 of these things and that each one came with a personalised engraved display case. Pretty braggable.
HE_Shotgun_XboxOne_112:The Rhino shotgun is a devastating short range projectile weapon. If you really want to make an entrance in style, bring the Rhino.
HE_LaserZeus_XboxOne_222:The instructions on this thing just say 'point front towards enemy' and 'use supplied goggles', but there aren’t any goggles here. I guess they forgot to pack the goggles.
HE_ArmourPlate_XboxOne_211:This Medium Armour Plate is tougher than the GSO one, but it's also more expensive and heavier.
HE_StdBlock_01_XboxOne_111:This block is heavy duty, strong and resilient. It's also a bit more expensive than that GSO rubbish.
HE_Bracket_4AP_XboxOne_111:A corner bracket used to take up less space allowing you to attach parts for less weight than a regular block.
HE_Cab_07_XboxOne_111:A sleak pilot style cab, perfect for stealth operations.
HE_Mini_Gun_20_XboxOne_111:The "N830RC" is a six-barrel rotary machine gun with a high rate of fire, which can also fire at a high sustained rate. It features a Gatling-style set of rotating barrels with an external power source.
HE_RailGun_XboxOne_113:The long range AKIRA railgun is a relatively new addition to the arsenal. Using high-powered electromagnets, this weapon will punch a hole in just about anything, no matter how far away they are.
HE_ShotgunRotating_XboxOne_212:The Axis Shotgun is mounted on a fully rotating turret. It has a little less power than the Bayonet Shotgun, takes up more space and fires a tad slower, but makes up for it in versatility.
HE_Wheel_Single_XboxOne_121:Perfect for scout vehicles. This wheel is fast and has plenty of attach points to load up a smaller Tech with some reasonable firepower.
HE_MachineGun_33_XboxOne_111:The old faithful STEN light machine gun. A favourite for low key ops.
HE_Suppressed_Mgun_XboxOne_111:Quiet, small and minimal kickback. This is just the tool for a smaller Tech that doesn't want to be thrown around by a large weapon (or to fill up some empty spaces with some more guns).
HE_TurretRoundabout_XboxOne_111:This quad barrel launcher fires further and does more damage than the GSO one. It also rotates, it's a little slow, but it does turn. It doesn't have as many barrels, but it makes use of the ones that it has.
VENBlock_PS4_111:Light and cheap. This will make for a speedy racer - but wont stand up to punishment.
VENBooster_PS4_111:A powerful pulse booster jet in a small package.\n\nThe Little Stud Pulse Booster system was created by a Metal Machinist known as Big Will McDonald. McDonald's breakthrough came whilst working on the "Space Fill" project, the idea was to avoid polluting the Earth by forgoing landfills in favour of blasting waste materials into outer space. The original problem was the expense of the process, it simply didn't make economic sense to pay for the fuel required. However, thanks to the combined breakthroughs of Oleite self-replenishing fuel tanks and McDonald's super efficient pulse booster technology, which many have described as "beyond effective", we no longer have to worry about the vast amounts of mess and wastage we produce as a species. We're now safe in the knowledge that we can just shoot it away into space for someone else to worry about!
VENCockpit_PS4_111:Your standard Venture cab. Comes with orange windscreen.\n\nBuilding upon his earlier successes with the Venture bracket system, Prof. Ruin of the Idont Institut tackled a much more complex project when he was approached again by Venture to devise an all-terrain Cab that could operate independently at high speeds under testing conditions. Prof. Ruin's POD Cab was a roaring success. The nippy little thing handles dunes and mountains with ease and is fast enough to make a quick exit when needed. It also comes equipped with a built-in PIP rifle, the little brother of the popular Venture Hail Fire. Ruin also had plans to include built-in missile launchers and a radar, but alas, they proved too expensive for the Venture brief. Ruin's next project for Venture is still a closely guarded secret, although insider reports have revealed that the project's codename is "The Tower".
VENMediumMachineGun_PS4_121:High rate of fire. Low focus. High recoil. This thing is a beast.
VENShotgunContact_PS4_111:The Venture Contact Shotgun is a powerful weapon to use at close range, but it won't work very well from a distance.
VENShotgunRotating_PS4_112:The 360 Shotgun rotates in all directions. It's less powerful than the Contact Shotgun and has a lower rate of fire. But it will stay on target no matter where the enemy goes.
VENStreamlineSmall_PS4_111:This streamlined small dinosaur head shaped block helps to neaten up the lines of your Venture Tech and also trades fewer Attach Points for a bit more armour.
VENTurretRoundabout_PS4_111:A twin barrel mortar launcher that can rotate all the way around and it can do it fast. Sure, these shells don't hit as hard as the GSO ones, or go quite as far, but they are much better at hitting their mark from a speeding buggy!
VENWheel_PS4_211:Small Venture wheels still leave everyone else in the dust.
EXP_Gyro_AllAxis_Active_212:A more powerful gyroscope to keep your Techs level, no matter what. This gyro is "active", meaning it will apply torque to force your Tech back to an upright position. And it's also "all axis", meaning it works in all three rotational directions.
EXP_PlasmaTeeth_311:A useful melee weapon to mount around the lower area of your Tech. It will stop anyone from getting too close by burning them with three plasma lances. Get two and flip one over to make a mean set of gnashers.
EXP_RailGunTurret_213:A more versatile Railgun fixed to a rotating turret mount. It loses some power due to the snub nosed barrel, but it makes up for it by being more likely to hit the mark.
EXP_Gyro_AllAxis_Active_222:A really heavy duty gyroscope powerful enough to correct a tilt on very large Techs. This gyro is "active", meaning it will apply torque to force your Tech back to an upright position. And it's also "all axis", meaning it works in all three rotational directions.
EXPMiniGunDual_312:What’s better than one big Auto Cannon? Two slightly smaller ones of course! These will really chew them up.
EXPMiningFlail_442:The Cat Nine Flail Guard is a great defensive tool for clearing away any bits and bobs that get too close to your wheels when mining. They're also pretty handy for keeping any troublemaking Techs from attacking you from the sides or back.
EXPMiningFlail_663:The Windmill Flail Guard is a professional version of the Cat Nine Flail Guard. A much heavier hitting tool, that can be fitted to Techs with a much higher ground clearance.
EXPNosePropBig_662:A large, powerful Nose Propeller to be used on larger aircraft.
EXPSonicLance_411:Developed by a fluidics engineer, Dr. Wren Hensgen. He was originally trying to create a new type of hydraulic trouser press, but got carried away and ended up with a sonic lance capable of launching 50 metric tons of machinery over a house.
EXPSteeringHover_212:These powerful Adjustment Thruster units can give more air control to heavy hovering Techs.
GCBlock_444:This is a very big Block. Possibly the biggest one. But that's been said before about other ones, so let's not get into that again. Anyway, this is a big one!
HE_Block_212:A tactical four pack Block. Heavy, hard and tough. Just like the two block, but twice as big.
HE_Block_213:This handy six pack block helps to build larger Techs in shorter amounts of time. Stop fiddling around with those ones and twos and get on with it.
VENBlockCorner_111:A light corner block to build Techs with some more interesting streamlined shapes to them. Fancy.
VENBlockZ1_312:Did you ever play that game where you have to make neat lines of Blocks in a row and they keep appearing faster and faster? Well the Z-shaped blocks were really helpful in that, right?
VENBlockZ2_312:This is just a mirrored version of the other Z-shaped Block. Do we really need two awkward Z-shaped Blocks? Two of them? Seriously?
BF_Block_111:A Better Future One Block. Yep, it's a One Block, I don't know what you were hoping to find here. You know it's a One Block, we know it's a One Block. It's a One Block.
BF_Block_Faired_111:This is a One Block, but with a little hat on it. Cute huh?
BF_Block_Smooth_111:This One Block has a hat on, but no attach point on top. It's all smooth and shiny.
BF_Streamline_111:A Streamlined One Block, perfect for sloping mid sections. Joins up well with the Streamlined Corner One Block.
BF_Streamline_112:This Streamlined Two Block is good for two long sloping sections. Works well with the Streamlined Corner Two Block.
BF_Streamline_113:Good for sloping sections that are Three Blocks long.
BF_Streamline_114:You get the idea by now right? This is used for sloping mid sections that are Four Blocks long.
BF_Streamline_115:A sloping Five Block. There isn't much more to say about this.
BF_Streamline_Corner_111:A nice way to round off the corners of any sections made with the Streamlined One Block.
BF_Streamline_Corner_112:This works perfectly with the Streamlined Two Block to finish off the corners.
BF_Streamline_Corner_113:This works well to finish off the corners for the Streamlined Three Blocks. You're really into reading the descriptions of fairly standard blocks aren't you? Let's throw in a little factoid to spice things up: did you know that owls can turn their heads up to 270 degrees? Now you do.
BF_Streamline_Corner_114:Put this on the end of your sloping Streamlined Four Block sections to make them look all neat and tidy.
BF_Streamline_Corner_115:Wow, this is a really big Streamlined Corner Block - five long huh? That is really something! Hoo wee! Well, blow me over with a feather.
BF_Streamline_Corner_212:This Wide Streamlined Corner works with well with the Streamlined Two Blocks. If you want to go for that wide flatter look. It's pretty good, I guess.
BF_Streamline_Corner_L_213:These Corner Wide blocks get a bit tricky now. You'll need both a left and a right variant to round off the wide corners on a sloping Streamlined Three Block section. I know it's a pain, but what can you do?
BF_Streamline_Corner_R_213:This is the Wide Right Streamlined Corner block to match the Wide Left variant. Stick these on the edges of a Streamlined Three Block section to get that cool wide look that everyone is always going on about.
BF_Streamline_Corner_L_214:A Left Wide Four Corner Streamlined Block. That's a bit of a mouthful isn't it.
BF_Streamline_Corner_R_214:The corresponding Wide Four Right Corner Streamlined Block. You asked for it, so we delivered it! Wait… you didn't ask for it? Oh, well… here it is anyway!
BF_Streamline_Corner_L_215:I bet you never thought you'd see the day when you had a Wide Five Left Streamlined Block to call your very own. Well good for you, you deserve it. Treat yourself.
BF_Streamline_Corner_R_215:You know that old saying - "Where there's a Wide Five Left Streamlined Block, you'll probably also find a Wide Five Right Streamlined Block." Something to think about there.
BF_Streamline_Extender_122:This extender is great when used with the Wide Streamlined Blocks on their side. You can make a whole new streamlined shape and it looks just as neat as before. Boom!
BF_Streamline_Extender_123:I know what you're thinking. "Oh my gosh! they do a Streamline Extender that is Three Blocks long?" You're darn right my friend. Stick a Three Wide Corner Block on the end of this and you've got yourself something pretty special, let me tell you.
BF_Cab_212:The Better Future eCab is the ultimate in Cab only freedom. It hovers, it moves around (sort of), it even has laser guns! Pew! pew! pew! Take that other Corporations!
BF_Wheel_Small_Angled_122:An entry level Halo wheel. This is a nice slim design for nippy little Techs that want to keep a low profile.
BF_Wheel_Small_Straight_222:With a beefier wide tyre, this Halo wheel is a bit more stable than the angled one.
BF_Wheel_Small_Side_222:Very similar to the Small Straight Halo wheel, but in a handy side mounting variant so that you can build your Tech how you want it.
BF_Wheel_Medium_Straight_233:The Medium Halo wheels are fast, responsive and look awesomely futuristic.
BF_Wing_Medium_Outside_413:These are powerful, responsive wings mounted on gimbals so that the whole wing will act as a flap.
BF_Booster_111:Look at this tiny booster! It really packs a good punch though. Remember to take a Fuel Tank with you to keep your Booster stocked and ready to go when you need it in a pinch.
BF_Hover_Ring_Large_424:Look at the size of this Hover Ring. What a beauty. Just like the smaller versions, this one doesn't have built in Hover Steering, but it's one of the most powerful hovers (for its size) and it can shift the direction of the Hover Ring to give it some basic steering.
BF_Hover_Ring_Small_212:The Hover Rings are more powerful than the flipper variants. They can lift more weight with ease. Whilst they don't feature integrated directional Hover Steering jets, the hover rings are mounted on gimbals and used vectored thrusting to help steer on their own.
BF_Streamline_Extender_124:Oh boy! Another Streamlined Extender Block? This one is good to be used with the Four Wide Corner Blocks.
BF_Streamline_Extender_125:The biggest Streamlined Extender Block going. This is it, the Five! I'm in awe of it.
BF_Wheel_Medium_Side_233:A tough medium sized Halo Wheel with side mountings.
BF_Wing_Medium_Middle_413:Use this powerful Middle Wing to build flying Techs with magnificent wing spans.
BF_Wing_Small_212:A tiny little diddly wing. This works well as a tail wing, or as a wing tip for the edge bits on your awesome flying Tech.
BF_Hover_Flipper_Medium_Left_323:The Hover Flippers are great versatile hover blocks. The internal hover ring will angle itself to give you some steering, but this block also has built in Adjustment Thrusters. Hover Tech Magazine said "If you only use one Hover Block this year, make it the Better Future Left Medium Hover Flipper." Although we recommend you use it in conjunction with the right variant too. It just works better that way.
BF_Hover_Flipper_Medium_Right_323:We're spoiling you, I know. Here we have a Right Medium Hover Flipper to go with your left one. Yeah, this one has vectored thrusting built into the internal hover ring and built-in Adjustment Thrusters to boot. We're too good to you sometimes.
BF_Hover_Flipper_Large_Left_424:A big tough Flipper Hover. This is the Left one. Built in-steering, vectored thrusting internal hover ring. What more can I say?
BF_Hover_Flipper_Large_Right_424:The Right Large Hover Flipper is possibly even better than the Left version. I sometimes have trouble choosing though. They're both so good!
BF_FuelTank_112:A tough little fuel tank. Make sure to take one of these with you if you're using Boosters.
BF_Hover_Steering_212:A very powerful Adjustment Thruster module. This can be built into the inside of your Tech if you plan carefully. Works great for guiding your ungrounded Techs through the air.
BF_Hover_Steering_111:The entry level Adjustment Thruster. This will help you steer your ungrounded Techs with a bit more ease.
BF_Hover_Steering_112:The mid-range Adjustment Thruster, a good all rounder. Just like the others, this one can be built into your Tech to hide it away.
BF_IonDrive_Small_112:Much like the propellers offered by other corporations, the Ion Drive requires no power or fuel to function. It works well for helping your ungrounded Techs get off the ground and keep it that way indefinitely. It also has an awesome blue trail.
BF_IonDrive_Medium_212:This is a great upgrade from the Small Ion Drive. Again, this one doesn't need power or fuel. It works very much like a propeller, but the sleek design opens up a whole new world of building options.
BF_Fin_116:This is just for looks, but what looks it offers! Wanna add mecha style 'bunny ear' bits to your Tech? Here you go! Need an awesome tail thing to finish off your hover jet powered flying whale tank? Here you go!
BF_Gyro_AllAxis_Active_111:This Active All Axis Gyro is great at stabilising hover craft and air craft Techs. It will apply torque in all directions to keep your Tech level. Do you just need to keep something upright? Use this.
BF_AGE_111:This is a Better Future block.
BF_Block_112:This Two Block is so great. Look at it. It's like two One Blocks, but stuck together. Nice!
BF_Block_113:This Three Block weighs less than three One Blocks, but it's just as tough. Save some weight and use these multiple blocks! 
BF_Block_114:This Four Block is lighter than four individual One Blocks would be. Use this one instead if you need to fill that space. It's just as tough too.
BF_Block_115:A Five Block that weighs less than five individual One Blocks? Awesome! And it's as strong as all those One Blocks would be combined? Cool.
BF_Chassis_212:Chassis Blocks are very light and very strong. Use these to fill up the empty space on the inside of a Tech instead of big heavy One Blocks.
BF_Chassis_312:Chassis Blocks are very light and very strong. Use these to fill up the empty space on the inside of a Tech instead of big heavy One Blocks.
BF_Chassis_313:Chassis Blocks are very light and very strong. Use these to fill up the empty space on the inside of a Tech instead of big heavy One Blocks.
BF_Chassis_314:Chassis Blocks are very light and very strong. Use these to fill up the empty space on the inside of a Tech instead of big heavy One Blocks.
BF_Laser_112:The Better Future Laser Rifle is a powerful and fast firing laser weapon with no kickback at all. There are very few downsides to this weapon. It's a bit expensive, but worth the price.
BF_Skid_133:This Landing Gear Skid will raise and lower automatically when your Tech lifts off or lands. It just works!
BF_Skid_143:Phwoarrr! Look at this Landing Gear Skid, isn't it great that it goes up and down on its own? Nice!
BF_Skid_254:This is a really big Landing Gear Skid. You could use it on a massive flying Tech. That would really be something sweet.
BF_Light_112:A nice streamlined Light. It fits in well with the Streamlined Two Blocks.
BF_Laser_Streamlined_112:A fast firing and powerful streamlined laser weapon. Pew pew pew pew pew pew!
BF_AirBrake_211:The Air Brake is mainly used for un-grounded Techs (hovercraft, planes, helicopters etc.), It will provide passive braking in a given direction when no input is detected. In other words, it'll slow you down when you stop driving, but only in the direction it is facing.
BF_AntiGravityEngine_111:This Anti-gravity Engine (AGE) requires power to function. Once working, it will reduce the effects of gravity on the attached Blocks within its area of influence. This is only a small one, great for starting out, it will reduce gravity by half on its Blocks, for greater reductions in gravity and areas of influence you'll want a larger one. Make sure to use gyros, hovers, props, wings and boosters to maintain control of your Tech with reduced gravity.
BF_AntiGravityEngine_212:This AGE reduces the effects of gravity on the attached Blocks within its area of influence. This one is more powerful than the Pip Engine, reducing gravity by two thirds on its Blocks, it also has a larger area of influence, but it also consumes more power to use. You can double AGEs up to reduce gravity even further all the way down to zero gravity.
BF_Booster_112:A solid mid-range Booster, it's not as powerful as something from Venture, but it doesn't drain your fuel as fast either.
BF_Control_HoverPower_111:Use the radial menu on this Block to switch all the Hovers on your Tech on or off, you can even adjust their power output to hover higher or lower in the air.
BF_Control_Killswitch_111:This Switch can control multiple Block types on your Tech, allowing them to be turned on or off. This Switch can be used for Anti-gravity Engines, Hovers, Shield Bubbles, Repair Bubbles.
BF_FuelTank_111:A compact little Fuel Tank, remember to bring lots of these if you want to use your Boosters.
BF_Gyro_AllAxis_Passive_111:This Passive Gyroscope does not apply torque to keep your Tech upright, only resistance to movements around all rotational axes. Active Gyros apply torque, meaning they will pick you up if you fall over, but passive gyros just make it harder to fall over in the first place, making your Tech more stable without impacting your control of it as much. Passive Gyros also behave differently depending on their placement on your Tech. Depending on the offset to the centre of gravity this Gyro will affect some axes more than others.
BF_Gyro_SingleAxis_Active_112:This Active Single Axis Gyro apply torque to keep your Tech upright, but only along one axis. For example, if you want to make a motorcycle that will not fall over sideways, but it still able to pull dank wheelies, this is the Gyro for you.
BF_Gyro_SingleAxis_Trim_Active_221:The Trim Gyro is technically an Active Single Axis Gyro (like the one that's good for motorcycles) but it also allows you to set an offset angle for the Gyro to tilt your Tech to. Attach it and access its radial menu to switch the Trim feature on or off, whilst on you can adjust the pitch angle at which it will attempt to hold your Tech in the air. This enables you to make diagonal builds that sit at the angle you want them to or make awesome flying Techs that keep an aggressive nose down posture.
BF_Laser_Gatling_423:A high power, fast firing Gatling Laser Cannon hidden behind a streamlined panel. You can pack some real firepower without messing up the clean minimalistic lines of your Tech.
BF_Laser_Streamlined_113:The Speed Lance Laser is strong and versatile weapon. It has a wide arc of fire and deals a good amount of damage.
BF_MotionEngine_Linear_112:The Linear Motion Engine does exactly what you'd expect, it provides throttled motion along a linear axis with the use of Anti-gravity technology. It'll lift your Tech up and down, left and right or forwards and back with a set of your throttle so no need to feather the controls. These are a great movement Block to use for Anti-gravity Techs.
BF_MotionEngine_Rotational_311:This is simply two Linear Motions Engines arranged in a Catherine Wheel formation. It will give continuous throttled rotational movement (torque) via Anti-gravity technology. Use these to make something spin indefinitely (or until it runs out of power). These are a fun way to rotate your Anti-gravity Techs.
BF_Stabiliser_Computer_111:This clever little computer will help you stay in once place when you stop driving most types of ungrounded Techs (hovercraft, helicopters and anti-gravity craft, not so much for planes though). When you stop driving, this computer will take over and steer your Hover Plates, Adjustment Thrusters and Propellers to try to keep you in one place and stop you from drifting around out of control.
BF_AirBrake_311:The Air Brake is mainly used for un-grounded Techs (hovercraft, planes, helicopters etc.), It will provide passive braking in a given direction when no input is detected. In other words, it'll slow you down when you stop driving, but only in the direction it is facing.

$ChunkDescription
CarbiteOre:An oily dusty fossil fuel that can be refined into an excellent explosive. It can also be consumed as a fair fuel source for generators.
CarbiusBrick:Carbius is used in the fabricaton of most explosives and projectile weaponry. It also makes an excellent fuel source when consumed by generators.
CelestianCrystal:Refined Celestian adds a greater level of strength to the natural physical energy properties that Celestite exhibits. More powerful anti-gravity and energy resistant items can be fabricated with it. When used in the creation of components, Celestian can produce near weightless metals, perfect for crafting airships with.
CelestiteShard:Celestite emits a powerful physical energy. It can be used as an ingredient in the fabrication of blocks that manipulate gravity or project holding and resisting beams.
ErudianCrystal:As with many crystalline elements, refining Erudite into Erudian enhances its natural qualities and allows for the production of more powerful sensor and A.I. blocks.
EruditeShard:Erudite emits a powerful sensory energy. It's almost as if it has some level of consciousness of its own. It can be used in the fabrication of items that require sensors or some level of A.I.
FibronChunk:A moderate fuel source. It can be consumed by generators.
IgnianCrystal:Refined Ignian is capable of focusing energy weapon beams to make them even more powerful. Conversely, when used as an alloy ingredient, it will produce materials that are extremely resistant to heat.
IgniteShard:This orange crystal ore exudes a powerful and hot energy. It can be used in the fabrication of destructive energy weapons and lasers.
LuxianCrystal:Luxian is the perfected refined state of Luxite. This cleaned up element is perfect for making blocks that emit light.\n\nSkellorn recognised the amazing potential for Luxite and wasted no time in sharing her findings (Tempus Fugit!). Many now believe that Luxite has the potential to solve world hunger and cure all disease. The wonder material has already been put to work in the creation of regenerative field technologies, habitation chambers, medical bays and food replication units.
LuxiteShard:Luxite is a crystalline ore that emits a bright and even light, even at night time. It can be used in the production of light emitting blocks.\n\nLuxite's vital and reparative properties were first identified and pioneered by kinesiologist and keen-gardener, Mary Beth Skellorn. She found that the raspberries grown amongst Luxite rich soil would yield an outstanding harvest, despite also attracting constant assaults from vast numbers of creepy crawlies (much to her annoyance). After close observation she discovered that a close proximity to the Luxite was enabling the berries to regrow almost as fast as they were being consumed.
OleiteJelly:A thick viscous jelly that can be consumed as a good fuel source for generators or refined into a powerful rocket fuel like substance.
OlasticBrick:A brick of refined Olastic will serve as an poor fuel source in furnace generators but can be a key ingredient when fabricating light but strong blocks.
PlumbiaIngot:The basic building material for most fabrication recipes. Keep a steady supply of this coming in.
PlumbiteOre:Used as the basic ingredient for some metallic blocks when crafting. Can be refined into a pure Ingot state.
RoditeOre:A bright electric blue powdery fossil rock. It has very corrosive qualities. Rodite can be refined into a very acidic liquid.
RodiusCapsule:Rodius is an extremely acidic and corrosive liquid. There may be weapons applications for this substance in the future. For now, we can use it in the production of components with electric properties.
RubberBrick:Rubber is used in the fabrication of all wheels with tyres and flexible or elasticated blocks.
RubberJelly:Rubber Jelly can be refined into a Rubber Brick. Whilst not as robust, Rubber Jelly is a cheap resource that can be used to make smaller wheels.
Stone:No real value or use… throw it away or sell it.
TitaniaIngot:Titania is used in the fabrication of many hard wearing metal blocks. Tools, blades and armour are great uses of the metal. It is much more dense than Plumbia.
TitaniteOre:A very dense hard metal ore, it can be refined into a very strong pure metal ingot.
Wood:Fibrewood is a basic fuel source. Generators can consume it to produce small amounts of electricity.\n\nDr. Tony Penev, a biologist, was first to identify and study the properties of much of the flora of this region, including this type of wood. Unfortunately it also happened to be the last specimen he identified, as he was blinded after looking directly into the beam of the COIL Laser that he was using to collect samples with. Penev is now retired and enjoys reading and playing computer games.
FibrePlating:Fibre Plating is a Component made from high density Fibron. It's fairly light, but also reasonably strong and cheap too. It won't stand up to heavy weapons as well as Plumbia and Titania based materials, but it's still fairly robust for the price and weight.
PlubonicGreebles:This Component contains all the nuts, bolts and other fastenings you will need to construct all sorts of doohickeys and thingamajigs.
HardenedTitanic:This is an incredibly tough material. Titania is one of the toughest metals ever discovered and this is a purified and galvanised plate of it.
BlastCaps:An explosive charge and reinforced barrel chamber. This all-purpose Component is used in the construction of a variety of different weapons and even far ranging applications like booster jets.
FuelInjector:A Fuel Injector nozzle is a key Component used in most engines. This is a much used Component in Wheels and Boosters.
AcidElectrode:A basic Rodistic electrode cell. A key Component needed for storing and distributing electric charges.
HeatCoil:This Heating Coil helps circulate engine coolant flows through radiator coils and air flows past the coils, which cools the coolant and heats the incoming air.
HardLightDrive:This Hard Light Drive is used to project gravity displacement fields. Its applications vary between Shield Bubbles, Hover Plates and SCU Storage Devices.
SensoryTransmitter:This Sensory Transmitter is an Erudian based processor used in the construction of A.I. Modules and Cabs.
RuggedFiblar:This Component is a more rugged version of Fibre Plating. A much stronger, reinforced and improved Component.
PlubonicAlloy:An upgraded set of fastenings and greebles made from an ultra heat treated and carbonised Plubonic Alloy. These are much harder wearing and used in the construction of higher grade blocks.
TitanicAlloy:Titanic Alloy is the ultimate form for anyone seeking a highly resistant material. This alloy is used in the production of nuclear grade blast shields.
Z4Explosives:A highly powerful explosive composite, Z4 Explosives are used in the production of most mid-range frag and high explosive munitions.
IonPulseCell:Ion Pulse Cell is a mid-range battery cell that holds a greater amount of charge in its enriched Rodistic cell.
CycloneJet:This Cyclone Jet is a form of Turboprop. Air is drawn into the intake and compressed by the compressor. Fuel is then added to the compressed air in the combustor, where the fuel-air mixture then combusts. The hot combustion gases expand through the turbine.
PlasmaEmitter:The Plasma Emitter works by projecting powerful beams at a perfectly cut Ignian prism which combine into a devastatingly powerful plasma beam.
ZeroPointSplitter:The Zero Point Splitter is a key Component used in creation of inter-dimensional rifts. It's a powerful and mysterious device that seems to be able to open portals to… somewhere else.
MotherBrain:This is a powerful synthetic brain, or learning computer. Mother Brain is a state of the art Component used in the construction of complex, self-aware A.I. units that can think and make decisions on their own.
DervishGel:Dervish Gel, also known as 'Liquid Hellfire.' A highly prized explosive Component as it's very stable and easily transportable and can be kept and stored for a long time. But when exposed to the correct charge, it is also one of the most violently explosive materials available.
CoffmanCell:The Coffman Cell is a Component that provides unparallelled charging speeds and storage. This device is used in the most bleeding edge electronic devices.
ThermoJet:The Thermo Jet Component helps to make the most powerful and efficient booster jet engines around.
GluonBeam:The Gluon Beam does not fire streams of gluons, but interferes with the gluons already present in any object targeted. The beam interferes with the fundamental interactions of matter, destabilising them until they implode.
SeedAI:Seed A.I. is an Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) which improves itself by recursively rewriting its own source code without human intervention. Initially this program had minimal intelligence, but over the course of many iterations it evolved beyond human-equivalent to trigger the singularity.
ProximaDark:The Proxima Dark Component is key to any warp engine used for FTL travel.

msgFilterAttached01:What's that, kiddo? What does the filter do?
msgFilterAttached02:The clue's in the name, of course!
msgFilterAttached03:It's a conveyor which filters chunks…

$Warnings
warningTitleGeneratorsNeedAnchors:Must be anchored
warningMsgGeneratorsNeedAnchors:This block will only work whilst anchored to the ground. It cannot function whilst in transit.
warningTitleLineOfSightBlocked:Line of sight blocked
warningMsgLineOfSightBlocked:This gun is unable to shoot at this angle, because it's obstructed by another block.
warningTitleShieldNotPowered:Bubble is not powered
warningMsgShieldNotPowered:Bubbles will only work connected to an active source of power.
warningTitleWheelsSuspended:Wheels can't reach the ground
warningMsgWheelsSuspended:You seem to be stuck because your Wheels are suspended above the ground. Try detaching a few pieces to release the Tech and then rebuilding to allow wheels to reach the ground.
warningTitleWheelsSideways:Wheel is sideways
warningMsgWheelsSideways:The Wheel that you have placed is stuck on sideways. This may slow down your Tech or stop it from moving completely if it is in contact with the ground.
warningTitleConveyorClogged:Conveyor clogged
warningMsgConveyorClogged:This Conveyor is clogged up with too many items. To unblock it, clear a few items out by dragging and dropping them elsewhere.
warningTitleBatteryLow:Battery low
warningMsgBattteryLow:This Battery is about to run out of energy. Any other blocks that are dependant on its power will cut out or shift to low power mode when all of the energy is exhausted.
warningTitleGeneratorNeedsStorage:Generator needs storage
warningMsgGeneratorNeedsStorage:This Generator does not have enough capacity to store the energy that consuming this chunk would yield. Attach more Batteries please.
warningTitleWheelSuspensionFullyCompressed:Wheel is overloaded
warningMsgWheelSuspensionFullyCompressed:This Wheel is attempting to support too much weight. It will move much slower whilst under this strain. Try adding more wheels to support it or reducing the load it is carrying.
warningTitleWrongOrientation:Wrong orientation

SteamLongDescription_D:Jump into a 16-player PvP battle to win the most fights within the time limit, or team up in a classic red vs. blue match.

SteamLongDescription_E:The Galactic Survey Organisation, commonly known as GSO, is the base Corporation in TerraTech.
